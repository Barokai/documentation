Grafana is an open source monitoring and visualization solution. It gives you
the ability to produce dashboards about your application metrics.

This tutorial will show you how to deploy a Grafana instance on Scalingo in
under 5 minutes.

## Grafana Deployment

We published a repository
[grafana-scalingo](https://github.com/Scalingo/grafana-scalingo/) on GitHub to
help you deploy Grafana on Scalingo. Deploying a Grafana instance is now at a
click range:

[![Deploy](https://cdn.scalingo.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://my.scalingo.com/deploy?source=https://github.com/Scalingo/grafana-scalingo)

## Deployment by Cloning the Repository

You first need to create an application on Scalingo. Let's say its name is
`my-app`.

Then, clone our repository and add the Scalingo git remote:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Scalingo/grafana-scalingo
$ cd grafana-scalingo
$ git remote add scalingo git@ssh.osc-fr1.scalingo.com:my-app.git
```

We now need to slightly configure the Scalingo application. This
application needs to use the [multi-buildpacks]({% post_url
platform/deployment/buildpacks/2000-01-01-multi %}).

You also must add a PostgreSQL addon to your application. Last, configure a
few Grafana specific environment variables by heading to your application web
dashboard:

```bash
GF_DATABASE_URL=$SCALINGO_POSTGRESQL_URL
GF_PATHS_PLUGINS=/app/plugins
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<Fill this field>
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=<Fill this field>
GF_SERVER_HTTP_PORT=$PORT
GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL=https://my-app.osc-fr1.scalingo.io
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
PLATFORM_ENV=production
```

You need to customize the variables `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER`,
`GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL` with correct values.

You can now deploy your application with:

```bash
$ git push scalingo master
```

### Display Images on External Services

You may want to display images on the alerts generated by Grafana and sent, for
example, on Slack. For this you need an S3 bucket configured via the following
environment variables:

```bash
GF_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3
GF_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<Fill this field>
GF_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=<Fill this field>
GF_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=<Fill this field>
GF_EXTERNAL_IMAGE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_KEY=<Fill this field>
```
