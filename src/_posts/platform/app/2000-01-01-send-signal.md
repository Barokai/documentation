## Introduction

Signals are standardized messages sent to a running program to trigger specific behavior.

On the Scalingo platform, sending signals is a useful way to trigger events while being the owner or collaborator of an application. This can be particularly useful for debugging purposes.

In this article we will talk about how to send a user-defined signal (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`) to a Scalingo hosted application.

{% note %}
  Only `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` are supported
{% endnote %}

## General purpose of the feature

As said before, implementing a signal handler can be a easy and powerful way to debug applications.

At Scalingo we often use signals handler to:

- Dump heap allocations
- Dump all stack traces
- Print the number of Goroutines
- Print the memory consumption
- etcâ€¦

## How to send a signal to an application ?

To send a signal to an application, multiple possibilities are available:

- The CLI provides a `send-signal` command.

```bash
$ scalingo -a my-app ps
+-------+---------+-------------+------+---------------------+
| NAME  | STATUS  |   COMMAND   | SIZE |     CREATED AT      |
+-------+---------+-------------+------+---------------------+
| web-1 | running | sample-test | M    | 2023/01/05 09:24:33 |
| web-2 | running | sample-test | M    | 2023/01/05 09:24:33 |
+-------+---------+-------------+------+---------------------+

$ scalingo -a my-app send-signal --signal SIGUSR1 web-1
-----> Sent signal 'SIGUSR1' to 'web-1' container.
```

- The CLI is a shortcut to send a signal via the API endpoint. More information about the API endpoint [here](https://developers.scalingo.com/apps#send-signal-to-a-container).

## Common issue
{% warning %}
  When transmitted to the container, the signal will be transmitted to the first process that started your application, also called the entry point.  
  Commonly, this entry point can be defined in the [Procfile](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/getting-started/heroku-compatibility#procfile), so be careful on which process will catch the signal first.
{% endwarning %}

For example, on a Node.js application, the default command run by Scalingo is `npm start` that runs a predefined command specified in the "start" property of a package's "scripts" object.  
If we send a signal to our application, the first process that will catch the signal is `npm start` that will not forward the signal to the desired process.  
You can find a Nods.js sample [here](https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-node-express) that can be deployed in one click.
