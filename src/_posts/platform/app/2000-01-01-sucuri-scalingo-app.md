## Integration purposes

Sucuri is a SaaS product helping you to protect your applications against a wide
variety of attacks. The role of Sucuri is to position itself between the users
of your apps and your app instances themselves, located in Scalingo
infrastructure.

## Let's Encrypt Certificate With Sucuri

Sucuri offers [HTTPS
termination](https://docs.sucuri.net/website-firewall/configuration/ssl-mode/)
so that your application is always reachable via HTTPS. However, in order to
fully protect your application, you should use "Full SSL" mode. This mode
requires Scalingo to generate a HTTPS certificate for your application. Scalingo
uses Let's Encrypt to generate a HTTPS certificate for your application with a
[custom domain]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-domain %}).

To generate and renew Let's Encrypt certificate, a specific route should be
accessible in plain HTTP, under the path `/.well-known/`. To make this route
reachable by Let's Encrypt server, you need to enable "Forward Certificate
Validation" in Sucuri dashboard.
