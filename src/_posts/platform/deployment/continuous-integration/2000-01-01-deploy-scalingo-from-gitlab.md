This page used to explain how to deploy your application using GitLab CI/CD.

Scalingo now allows you to automatically deploy your application when `git push`-ing to your GitLab repository. Please refer to the [GitLab integration]({% post_url platform/deployment/2000-01-01-deploy-with-gitlab %}) page.
