## Definition

SSH protocol is using cryptography for multiple features (Key exchange,
Signature, Encryption, Message Authentication Code). Each of these feature use
a set of cryptography algorithms.

This page aims at listing compatible algorithms with the Scalingo platform.

## Scope

SSH Servers used for:
* [Git-related operations]({ post_url platform/deployment/2000-01-01-deploy-with-git })
* [SSH Tunnel to access databases]({ post_url platform/databases/2000-01-01-access })

### Compatibility

Minimum version of OpenSSH to connect to these servers is 7.2, released in February 2016.
