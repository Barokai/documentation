## Definition

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that ensures the confidentiality of exchanges between applications and users on the Internet. When a server and client communicate, TLS ensures that no third party can intercept or falsify a message. TLS is the successor to the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol.


This page aims at listing compatible TLS version with the Scalingo platform.
