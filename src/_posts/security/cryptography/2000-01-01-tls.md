## Definition

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that ensures the confidentiality of exchanges between applications and users on the Internet. When a server and client communicate, TLS ensures that no third party can intercept or falsify a message. TLS is the successor to the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol.

This page aims at listing compatible TLS versions with the Scalingo platform.

## Scopes

Front servers used for:
* Reaching hosted applications on Scalingo.
* Reaching hosted databases on Scalingo.


## List of supported TLS versions

```
1.3
1.2
```

## List of supported cipher suites

```
# For TLS 1.3
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384        ECDH  x25519 	256
TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256  ECDH  x25519 	256
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256        ECDH  x25519 	128

# For TLS 1.2
