## Definition

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that ensures the confidentiality of exchanges between applications and users on the Internet. When a server and client communicate, TLS ensures that no third party can intercept or falsify a message. TLS is the successor to the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol.

This page aims at listing compatible TLS versions with the Scalingo platform.

## Scopes

Front servers which handle all incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests (see [reverse proxy](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/internals/network#reverse-proxy))


## List of Supported TLS Versions

* 1.3
* 1.2

## List of Supported Cipher Suites

```
# For TLS 1.3
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384        ECDH  x25519 	256
TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256  ECDH  x25519 	256
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256        ECDH  x25519 	128

# For TLS 1.2
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384  ECDH  x25519     256
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384    DH    2048 bits  256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256  ECDH  x25519     128
```
