## How to sign a GDPR DPA with Scalingo?

We have made it easy for you to comply with your own obligations. If you are a
Scalingo customer and have determined that you qualify as a Data Controller
under the GDPR, you may need a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) in place with
Scalingo as a qualifying vendor. Weâ€™ve made that part of the process easy for
you.

This is all you need to do:

- Go [here](https://cdn.scalingo.com/pdf/scalingo-dpa-customer-20180523.pdf) to find our GDPR-compliant DPA, which has been pre-signed on behalf of Scalingo.
- To complete the DPA, you should fill in the information in the "On behalf of the Customer" box and sign on Page 8.
- Submit the completed and signed DPA to Scalingo to [dpo@scalingo.com](mailto:dpo@scalingo.com).
- Upon submitting the validly completed DPA to the email address provided above, the DPA will become legally binding.
