TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension for the support of the time-series data.
This extension add several features and functions, you can find more information
on their documentation: [https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest).

There are multiple licences of TimescaleDB, __Community edition__ and
__Open-source edition__. The latter is the only one available on Scalingo, hence
TimescaleDB's functions labeled "community" on their documentation
are not available on the platform.

Several important features for time-series databases not available on the
Open-source edition. It is still possible without the functions to put them in
place, we present some of them here.
