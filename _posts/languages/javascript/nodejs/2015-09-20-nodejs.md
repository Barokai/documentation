## Buildpack

[Node.js Buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack)

## Standard node applications

### Node.js app detection

The file `package.json` should be present at the root of the project.

### NPM dependencies installation

The dependencies of your project are installed according to the
`package.json` content using `npm`.

### Specifying a NodeJS version

In your `engines` section of your `package.json` file, you can specify a version of Node.js to use. If no version is defined, we'll install the latest stable version. It's exactly the same with `npm` if you want to use a specific version of it.

```javascript
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "engines": {
    "node": "4.2.x",
    "npm": "2.14.x"
  }
}
```

### Node.JS app startup

What we use in order of priority

1. `Procfile` at the root of your project
2. The field `.scripts.start` defined in your `package.json` 

Example of package.json:

```javascript
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

## Meteor application

If a `.meteor` file is detected at the root of your project, your app will
be considered as a Meteor application.

See the [Meteor applications documentation]({% post_url 2015-03-22-meteor %})
