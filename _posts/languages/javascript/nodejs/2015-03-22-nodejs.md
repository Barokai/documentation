## Buildpack

[Node.js Buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack)

## Standard node applications

### Node.js app detection

The file `package.json` should be present at the root of the project.

### NPM dependencies installation

The dependencies of your project are installed according to the
`package.json` content using `npm`.

### Node.JS app startup

What we use in order of priority

1. `Procfile` at the root of your project
2. The field `.scripts.start` defined in your `package.json` 
3. We start `server.js` if present.

## Meteor application

If a `.meteor` file is detected at the root of your project, your app will
be considered as a Meteor application.

See the [Meteor applications documentation]({% post_url /languages/javascript/meteor/2015-03-22-intro-meteor %})
