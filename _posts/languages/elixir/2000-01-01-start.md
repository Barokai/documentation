We support Elixir through the community buildpack for Elixir:
[https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir).

## Elixir detection

For your Elixir app to be detected you have to declare explicitely the above 
mentionned buildpack in your application's source code.
To do this, create a file named `.buildpacks` with the following content:

```bash
https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir
```

## Configuration

In order to configure the buildpack, please add a `elixir_buildpack.config`
file at the root of the application. This file is a bash file. In order to
configure the OTP version:

```bash
erlang_version=21.2.6
```

A comprehensive list of configuration options is available
[here](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir#configuration){:target="_blank"}.
The configuration applied by default is
[here](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir/blob/master/elixir_buildpack.config){:target="_blank"}.

{% note %}
You should always specify your Elixir and OTP target versions. The buildpack
defaults are several versions back and may not work with your application
if you are up to date.
{% endnote %}

## Phoenix Web Framework

[Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) support requires combining the
[elixir buildpack mentionned above](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir)
and a [phoenix specific buildpack](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static):
the first one handles compiling the Elixir code, the second one handles the assets compilation.

Create a file named `.buildpacks` in your project which will define the buildpacks to use:

```bash
https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir
https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static
```

### Configuration

The phoenix buildpack can be configured using the `phoenix_static_buildpack.config`
file:

```bash
node_version=12.0
```

A comprehensive list of configuration options is available
[here](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static#configuration){:target="_blank"}.
The configuration applied by default is
[here](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static/blob/master/phoenix_static_buildpack.config){:target="_blank"}.


{% note %}
Here too, you should always specify your node version. The buildpack
defaults are several versions back and may not work with your application
if you are up to date.
