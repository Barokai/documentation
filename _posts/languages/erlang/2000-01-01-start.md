Erlang is officially supported on the platform.

It uses [Rebar](https://github.com/rebar/rebar) or
[Rebar3](https://github.com/rebar/rebar3).

### Configure your Scalingo App

```bash
$ scalingo create my-app
```

Nothing else.

### Select an Erlang version

The Erlang/OTP release version that will be used to build and run your
application is now sourced from a dotfile called `.preferred_otp_version`. It
needs to be the branch or tag name from the
[https://github.com/erlang/otp](https://github.com/erlang/otp) repository, and
further, needs to be one of the versions that precompiled binaries are available
for.

Currently supported OTP versions depend on the stack:

scalingo-18:

* OTP-22.3.4.18
* OTP-23.3.4
* OTP-24.0.1 *

To select the version for your app:

```bash
$ echo OTP-22.2.7 > .preferred_otp_version
$ git commit -m "Select 22.2.7 as preferred OTP version" .preferred_otp_version
```

### Build your Scalingo App

```bash
$ git push scalingo master
```

You may need to write a new commit and push if your code was already up to date.
