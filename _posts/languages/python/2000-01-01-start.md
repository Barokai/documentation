The Python language is officially supported on the platform.

## Detection

To ensure our deployment system considers your application as a Python
application, a file `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` should be present at the
root of your project, defining the dependencies of your app.

## Versions

Python 2 and Python 3 are both completely supported, you can specify the
runtime version in the `runtime.txt` file at the root of your repository.

Example of `runtime.txt` which would install Python 3.6.4:

```text
python-3.6.4
```

## Frameworks

We handle most of the common frameworks. Obviously, Django is among them. You just need to
configure your application to bind the port defined by the environment variable `$PORT`.

## Supported Versions

* 3.6.4
* 2.7.14

## Specific Python Buildpack Hooks

You may want to trigger custom actions after a successful deployment. The [postdeploy hook]({%
post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-postdeploy-hook %}) is exactly what you need. But your
application may require some actions to be executed during the deployment.

The Python buildpack can execute two hooks: before and after the installation of Python and its
dependencies. They must be located in the `bin` root folder of your application and be named
`pre_compile` and `post_compile`.
