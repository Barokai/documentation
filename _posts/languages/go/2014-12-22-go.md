## Deploying a Go application

### Using Godeps

When deploying a go application it is important to ensure that the
compilation is completely reproducible.  Godeps ensures this by vendoring
all the third-party dependencies of your project in the `Godeps/_workspace`
directory of your project.

#### Setting up Godeps

{% highlight bash %}
go get github.com/tools/godep
godep save <package of your project>
git add Godeps
git commit -m "Vendor all dependencies with Godeps"
{% endhighlight %}

For more details about the management of these vendored dependencies,
refer to [the Godeps documentation](https://github.com/tools/godep).

#### Defining a Procfile

{% highlight yaml %}
web: <base package name>
{% endhighlight %}

Example if your package is `github.com/user/example`:

{% highlight yaml %}
web: example
{% endhighlight %}

You can find an example at: https://github.com/Scalingo/sample-go-martini

### Using .godir (Deprecated)

The alternative is to use a `.godir` file a the root of your project
defining the name of your project binary. All the dependencies will be
downloaded using `go get` and in this case the repeatability of the
operation is not ensured.

`.godir`:
{% highlight text %}
my-sample
{% endhighlight %}

`Procfile`:
{% highlight yaml %}
web: my-sample
{% endhighlight %}
