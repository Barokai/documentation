## Detection

When a PHP application is deployed, we're looking at the composer.json file to
know if it is using a particular framework. For **Laravel**, we're looking
if the Composer dependencies contain `laravel/framework`. If so, your app is
deployed as a Laravel application.

```javascript
{
  "require": {
    "laravel/framework": "~7.2",
    // ....
  }
}
```

During the deployment process you'll see the following output, mentioning that
the framework has correctly been detected.

```
-----> Detected Laravel App
-----> Setting up Laravel App
```

## Configuration

A **Laravel** application requires the `APP_KEY` environment variable to be
defined with a random string. The `artisan` script can generate one for you:

```bash
scalingo env-set APP_KEY=$(php artisan --no-ansi key:generate --show)
```

Your application also requires a database, often a SQL database like MySQL
or PostgreSQL. This article will be using MySQL, but it should be identical with
a PostgreSQL database.

First, a [MySQL]({% post_url
databases/mysql/2000-01-01-start %}) has to be added to your
application. This addon will inject the environment variable `SCALINGO_MYSQL_URL`
and its alias `DATABASE_URL`.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:pass@my-db.mysql.dbs.com:30000/my-db
```

To use this URL in your application, add at the top of your
`app/config/database.php` file the following lines. They decompose the URL into
the different fields and let you configure your application.

```php
$url = parse_url(getenv("DATABASE_URL"));

$host = $url["host"];
$username = $url["user"];
$password = $url["pass"];
$database = substr($url["path"], 1);
```

Then find the `mysql` entry in the `database.php` file and modify it like:

```php
    'mysql' => array(
        'driver'    => 'mysql',
        'host'      => $host,
        'database'  => $database,
        'username'  => $username,
        'password'  => $password,
        'charset'   => 'utf8',
        'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
        'prefix'    => '',
    ),
```

Now that your application database is configured, let's work on the migrations.

## Migrations

Artisan is the command-line interface included with Laravel. It provides a
number of helpful commands that can assist you while you build your
application.

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to
modify and share the application's database schema. Migrations are
typically paired with Laravel's schema builder to build your
application's database schema. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to
manually add a column to their local database schema, you've faced the problem
that database migrations solve.

### First Migration

Creating a migration with **Laravel** is done with the following command on your
workstation.

```bash
./artisan make:migration create_plants
```

The file is created at the location `database/migrations/date_yourmigration`. Edit
it to write the content of the migration.

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('plants', function($table) {
        $table->increments('id');
        $table->string('common_name', 100);
        $table->string('latin_name', 100);
        $table->text('description');
    });
}

public function down()
{
    Schema::drop('plants');
}
```

To run locally the migration to see if the syntax is right, run the following command:

```
./artisan migrate
```

If everything went well, add this file to your Git repository and deploy the
application on the platform. Once the application has been deployed, apply the
migration to your production database:

```bash
scalingo --app my-app run php artisan migrate
```

For every migration file, a `down` method should be written in the case we want
to rollback database migrations:

```bash
scalingo --app my-app run php artisan migrate:rollback
```

### Another Example: Alter a Database Table

The previous example created a 'table creation' migration, here is an example of
table alteration.

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::table('plants', function($table) {
        $table->unique('latin_name', 'plants_unique_latin_name');
    });
}

public function down()
{
    Schema::table('authors', function($table) {
        $table->dropUnique('plants_unique_latin_name');
    });
}
```

As previously, running the migration on the hosted application once deployed:

```bash
scalingo --app my-app run php artisan migrate
```

For more examples, refer to [the official Laravel
documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/migrations).

## Apply Migrations Automatically after Deployment

So far the action to apply migrations on the production database was manual. It
is possible to automate it by using [a postdeploy hook]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-postdeploy-hook %}) All you have to do is to create a `Procfile`
file at the root of your project with the following content:

```yaml
postdeploy: php artisan migrate --no-interaction --force
```

That's it! If a deployment is a success, the command applying migrations will
be automatically run.

## Laravel Queues

Handling Laravel queues requires you to start [another process]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %}) in your application. Add the following line to the `Procfile`
of your application:

```yaml
queues: php artisan queue:work --queue=high,default
```

The arguments of the `--queue` option must be customized to suit your needs. After deploying your
application, you must scale the newly created type of containers `queues` at least to 1.

## Laravel Tasks Scheduler

The Laravel PHP framework includes a command scheduler for asynchronous tasks. However, Laravel's
[documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/scheduling#introduction) states you need to add a cron
entry which is not possible on Scalingo.

This documentation page guides you to let your application use the Laravel command scheduler on
Scalingo. The following command must be added to your app. It calls the Laravel scheduler every
minutes. It requires you to start [another process]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %})
in your application.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Carbon\Carbon;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;

class SchedulerDaemon extends Command
{
  /**
   * The name and signature of the console command.
   *
   * @var string
   */
  protected $signature = 'schedule:daemon {--sleep=60}';

  /**
   * The console command description.
   *
   * @var string
   */
  protected $description = 'Call the scheduler every minute.';

  /**
   * Execute the console command.
   *
   * @return mixed
   */
  public function handle()
  {
      while (true) {
          $this->line('<info>[' . Carbon::now()->format('Y-m-d H:i:s') . ']</info> Calling scheduler');

          $this->call('schedule:run');

          sleep($this->option('sleep'));
      }
  }
}
```

Don't forget to add the following line to the `Procfile` of your application:

```
scheduler: php artisan schedule:daemon
```

To define the jobs the scheduler will run, check the
[Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/scheduling#introduction),
it consists in modifying the `schedule` method in the file `app/Console/Kernel.php`.

Example:

```php
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        $schedule->call(function () {
            // Do something
        })->daily();
    }
```

Based on an article on [Neon
Tsunami](https://www.neontsunami.com/posts/laravel-scheduler-on-heroku).

## A Cron Example

A recurring need of PHP application is to execute multiple tasks at regular
interval, in a cron-like fashion. This section explains how to set this up on a
Scalingo application.

You first need to configure the [Laravel Tasks
Scheduler](#laravel-tasks-scheduler). Once this step is achieved, you need to
list the tasks you want to execute.

This is done in the `schedule` method of the `App\Console\Kernel` class. Here is
an example of two tasks scheduled at regular interval. The method `Foo1` will be
executed daily and the method `Foo2` will be executed hourly.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console;

use DB;
use Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Console\Kernel as ConsoleKernel;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    [...]

    /**
     * Define the application's command schedule.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule  $schedule
     * @return void
     */
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        $schedule->call(function () { Foo1(); })->daily();
        $schedule->call(function () { Foo2(); })->hourly();
    }
}
```

The Laravel documentation about this feature is available
[here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/scheduling#defining-schedules).

## Configure Passport

[Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/master/passport) provides a full OAuth2 server implementation for Laravel.

Usage on Scalingo requires two steps:
- transfer the information generated during `passport:install` into the production container via env variables
- configure composer to export some env variables into files and run `artisan passport:keys` at each deployment

To transfer the information, use the CLI env-set command:

```
# Install passport, this will output <id> and <secret>
php artisan passport:install

# Set data into container env variables
scalingo env-set \
  "OAUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat storage/oauth-private.key)" \
  "OAUTH_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat storage/oauth-public.key)"
  PASSPORT_CLIENT_ID=<id> \
  PASSPORT_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret> \
  # If mix app (with vue front)
  MIX_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<id> \
  MIX_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>

# Remove these files as they should only be used in the deployed environment not in dev
rm storage/oauth-private.key storage/oauth-public.key
```

To configure composer to export some env keys into files and run `artisan passport:keys` at each deployment, update the `scripts` element of your composer.json to integrate the values (`post-install-cmd`, `post-create-project-cmd`) below:

```json
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [
            "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
            "@php artisan package:discover --ansi"
        ],
        "post-root-package-install": [
            "@php -r \"file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');\""
        ],
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "[ -n \"$OAUTH_PUBLIC_KEY\" ] && echo \"$OAUTH_PUBLIC_KEY\" > storage/oauth-public.key",
            "[ -n \"$OAUTH_PRIVATE_KEY\" ] && echo \"$OAUTH_PRIVATE_KEY\" > storage/oauth-private.key"
        ],
        "post-create-project-cmd": [
            "@php artisan key:generate --ansi"
        ]
    }
```
