You may need to rollback a previous version of your code after deploying a
build containing bugs or incorrect behavior.

## A few warnings

If the new version of your code has been applying data migrations in your database,
some of them might be breaking the previous versions of your app. Thus, rolling back
to one of those would only create more problems, in this case, it's probably more
efficient to right down the required code to fix what is not working correctly in your
app, with the new data in head.

## Git method

The easiest method to rollback your code is to `git push` the commit you need to restore.
If the faulty commit is `c0d7a61`, and you know that the commit `40b63a6` was working,
you can push this commit again with the following command line:

```
git push scalingo 40b63a6:master
```

This command will push the working commit on the Scalingo `master` branch, and as a result,
trigger the deployment of this previous version `40b63a6`. The deployment will be running
as usually and replace the running app in case of success.
