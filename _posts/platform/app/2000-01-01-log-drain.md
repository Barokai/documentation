## Integration Purposes

When an application starts having a higher traffic, reading logs can be cumbersome. Using a log
management solution to gather the logs from all your applications and all your containers eases your
work when trying to find an information amongst all these lines of logs. A few SaaS solutions exist
such as Logentries, Logmatic.io or Papertrail. You can also host such solution on Scalingo. Here is
a tutorial on [how to deploy the ELK
stack](https://scalingo.com/articles/2018/02/23/running-the-elk-stack-on-scalingo.html) on Scalingo.

## Configuration of your Application on Scalingo

As this feature is private beta, you cannot activate logs drain by yourself. You just need to add an
environment variable containing the token to the used logs management service, and contact the
support so that we activate the logs drain. In a matter of minutes, your logs flow to the logs
management service.
