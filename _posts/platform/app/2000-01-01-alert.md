Scalingo lets you create alerts on an application metric. When the metric's value goes above a
user-defined limit, Scalingo send a notification on some specified notifiers.

An alert can be added to an application by going to the "Notifications" tab of your app:

{% assign img_url = 'https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_alerts_card.png' %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

## Alert Parameters

In order to create a new alert, a few parameters must be provided:

- Container type: can be any container type of an application (e.g. web, clock...).
- Metric: e.g. RPM per container, RAM consumption...
- Limit: any float value. For any resource consumption, please provide `0.1` if you need to be
  alerted when the consumption goes above `10%`.
- Remind every: send the alert at regular interval when activated.
- Send when below: send the alert when metric value is _below_ the limit.
- Disabled: the alert do not send any notification when disabled.
- Notifiers: list of [notifiers]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-notification %}) the alert send
  a notification to.

## Monitoring alert events

Every time an alert is triggered, an event is created. This event appears on the application's
timeline. The user responsible for the operation is labeled `scalingo-platform`.

{% assign img_url = 'https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_alerts_timeline.png' %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

Notifications for such events are sent if you set it up in the Notifications section. A guide to
configure these notifications is available [here]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-notification %}).
