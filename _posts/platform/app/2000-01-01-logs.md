Application logs can help you understand what is happening inside your application when deployed in production. Logs are especially useful for debugging problems and monitoring your application activity.

On Scalingo, everything your application writes on `stdout` and `stderr` is captured and gathered into the application logs. These logs are accessible through [Scalingo CLI]({% post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-features %}) or through the web dashboard in the "Logs" tab:

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_logs.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

When opening the "Logs" tab, the last 100 lines are displayed and all new lines are automatically streaming to your browser.

If you need a bit of historical logs, you should use the Scalingo CLI with:

```shell
scalingo --app my-app logs --lines <number of log lines>
```

Replace `<number of log lines>` with the amount of lines you want to display.

These live logs are called **hot logs**: they are the most recent logs of your application. When your application logged more than 50 MiB logs, Scalingo archive them in a log archive. We call them **cold logs**: they are not as recent as the hot logs but can be looked up for later analysis.

## Logs Archives

All your logs are archived by Scalingo for one year. When your log file grows bigger than 50 MiB, it is archived automatically. It is then available in the Logs Archive. Archived logs are no longer available with the `logs` command of the CLI.

On the dashboard side, logs archives are available in the "Logs" tab, under the "Archives" link:

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_logs_archives.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

These archives are also accessible using the CLI:

```
scalingo --app my-app logs-archives
```

## Log Drain

You may want to forward logs to third party providers for high level search and alerting capabilities. This is configurable using our [Log Drain]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-log-drain %}) feature.
