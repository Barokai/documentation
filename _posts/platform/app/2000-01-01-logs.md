Application's logs are accessible through [Scalingo CLI]({% post_url
platform/cli/2000-01-01-features %}) or through the web dashboard in the "Logs" tab:

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/screenshot_dashboard_logs.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

Logs are automatically streaming to your browser.

If you need a bit of historical logs, you should use the Scalingo CLI with:

```
scalingo --app my-app logs --lines <number of log lines>
```

Just replace `<number of log lines>` with the amount of lines you want to display. If the logs you
are interested in are too old, you might not be able to fetch them using the CLI.

Back to the dashboard, logs archives are available in the "Logs" tab, under the "Archives" link. All
your application logs since its creation are available here.
