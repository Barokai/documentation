## Priority Between Means of Payment

Scalingo offers various means of payment and you can complete multiple of them
in your [billing profile](https://my.scalingo.com/billing). When a new bill is
generated for your account, Scalingo charges the different means of payment in
this order:

- Scalingo credit,
- credit card,
- Paypal,
- SEPA.

## What Happens in Case of Failed Payment?

It can happen that a payment of a bill fails. There are many reasons for that:
credit card expiration, bank rejection... In such case, you need to update an
existing payment method or add a new one. Then Scalingo automatically retry the
payment and you are good to go!
