Scalingo is available on multiple regions. Here is the list of publicly
available regions:

| Name  | Code name | Provider | API endpoint | Dashboard |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 3DS Outscale Paris  | osc-fr1  | [3DS Outscale](https://outscale.com/) | [link](https://api.osc-fr1.scalingo.com) | [link](https://my.osc-fr1.scalingo.com) |
| 3DS Outscale Paris SecNumCloud  | osc-secnum-fr1  | [3DS Outscale](https://outscale.com/) | [link](https://api.osc-secnum-fr1.scalingo.com) | [link](https://my.osc-secnum-fr1.scalingo.com) |

## Accessing a Specific Region

### Using the Web Dashboard

When using the web dashboard at
[https://my.scalingo.com](https://my.scalingo.com), you will automatically be
redirected to the region you have access to. If your account has access to
multiple regions, a selection screen will be presented to let you chose which
region you want to use:

{% assign img_url = "https://cdn.scalingo.com/documentation/internals/screenshot_dashboard_regions_selection.png" %}
{% include mdl_img.html %}

You can also directly head to a region's dashboard:

- Agora Calycé Paris:
  [https://my.agora-fr1.scalingo.com](https://my.agora-fr1.scalingo.com)
- 3DS Outscale Paris:
  [https://my.osc-fr1.scalingo.com](https://my.osc-fr1.scalingo.com)
- 3DS Outscale Paris SecNumCloud:
  [https://my.osc-secnum-fr1.scalingo.com](https://my.osc-secnum-fr1.scalingo.com)

### Using the CLI

If you use the CLI to manage your app, all commands now have the flag `--region`
to specify the region you want to use. The region can also be globally set once
with `scalingo config --region <region name>` or by defining the environment
variable `SCALINGO_REGION`. The name of the region to use can be found with:

```bash
$ scalingo regions
+----------------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
|      NAME      |            DISPLAY             |              API ENDPOINT               |
+----------------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| agora-fr1      | Paris - Agora                  | https://api.agora-fr1.scalingo.com      |
| osc-fr1        | Paris - Outscale               | https://api.osc-fr1.scalingo.com        |
| osc-secnum-fr1 | Paris - SecNumCloud - Outscale | https://api.osc-secnum-fr1.scalingo.com |
+----------------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
```

## Migrating Application Between regions

There is currently no automatic way to migrate an application from one region to
another. An automatic procedure will be proposed in a couple of weeks. Most
applications will be able to enjoy 1-click migration with their databases with
minimal interruption. Waiting for it, here is the procedure to manually migrate
an application from one region to another:

1. Create and deploy the application on the new region,
1. Provision all the mandatory databases for this new application,
1. Copy data from the old database to the new one,
1. Update the DNS record to point to the app deployed on the new region.
