## Purpose of This Buildpack

You may need to combine several technologies in your project, this buildpack is here to fulfill this need.

## Set up This Buildpack for Your Application

If your application contains a `.buildpacks` file at its root, our deployment
system will automatically use this buildpack.

{% note %}
The environment variable `BUILDPACK_URL` used to be required to use the
multi-buildpack but it's not the case anymore, the `.buildpacks` file is enough
{% endnote %}

## Choice of the Buildpacks To Use

Create a file named `.buildpacks` in your project which will define the buildpacks to use:

```bash
https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack.git
https://github.com/Scalingo/go-buildpack.git
```

Add this file to your git repository:

```bash
git add .buildpacks
git commit -m "Setup .buildpacks for using multiple buildpacks on Scalingo"
```

Finally in this example, thanks to this method, both Node.js buildpack and Go buildpack will be applied
on your project.

  %}).

### Can I Checkout a Custom Buildpack Branch

Yes.

You have to use the syntax `URL#branchname` in your `.buildpacks` file:

```
https://github.com/Scalingo/java-buildpack#javaonly
```

### Does the Buildpack Order Matter?

Yes.

The multi buildpacks tries to detect the way to start your application from the
last buildpack you are installing. As a result, if your application is a **Node.js**
application and you need to run the **Java** buildpack to install a custom JDK.
You need to have the **Node.js** buildpack last:

```
https://github.com/Scalingo/java-buildpack#javaonly
https://github.com/Scalingo/nodejs-buildpack
```

Without doing that, if you don't have a [Procfile]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-procfile %}), your application will fail to boot.

## Deploy Your Application

```bash
git push scalingo master
```
