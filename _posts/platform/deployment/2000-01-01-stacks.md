Applications on Scalingo are executed inside a Docker container. This Docker
container is maintained by Scalingo and based on an image of a well-known Linux
distribution.

Scalingo currently supports two stacks based on Ubuntu:

| Stack | Base Distribution | Supported Until |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| `scalingo` | Ubuntu 14.04 | April 2022 |
| `scalingo-18` | Ubuntu 18.04 | April 2028 |
{: .table }

All Scalingo buildpacks officially supported by Scalingo are compatible with
all stacks.

The default stack for all newly created applications is `scalingo-18`.

## Viewing Stack Used by your Application

The stack used by your application is available using Scalingo [CLI]({%
post_url platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %}):

```shell
scalingo --app my-app apps-info
+----------------+-------------+
|    SETTINGS    |    VALUE    |
+----------------+-------------+
[...]
| Stack          | scalingo-18 |
[...]
+----------------+-------------+
```

## Migrating to a New Stack

You can view the list of available stacks with Scalingo [CLI]({% post_url
platform/cli/2000-01-01-start %}):

```shell
scalingo stacks
```

You might need to update your code before switching to a new app. Best solution
to test your application for this change is to create a [review app]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-review-apps %}) and add a `scalingo.json` file
containing:

```json
{
  "stack": "scalingo-18"
}
```

Make sure your review app deploys successfully. Once your application is ready
for the new stack, switch to the last stack with:

```shell
scalingo --app my-app stacks-set scalingo-18
```

Then redeploy your application:

```shell
git commit --allow-empty -m "Upgrading to scalingo-18"
git push scalingo master
```
