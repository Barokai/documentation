## Introduction

A good practice in software development is known as Continuous Integration (CI).
This practice consists of merging all developers work at regular interval to a
shared repository. This practice is often associated to automatic execution of
unit tests and Continuous Deployment (CD).

Scalingo integrates with most CI/CD tools. We wrote a guide for the most
well-known:

- [Bitbucket]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-bitbucket %})
- [CircleCI]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-circle-ci %})
- [Codeship]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-codeship %})
- [SemaphoreCI]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-semaphore-ci %})
- [Travis CI]({% post_url platform/deployment/continuous-integration/2000-01-01-deploy-scalingo-from-travis-ci %})
