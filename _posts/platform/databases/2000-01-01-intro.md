You applications need databases to store your data. As we believe your data
should be located geographically close to your application servers we support
the most common types of database.

We ensure your database is located at the same location as your applications.
It provides the best performance and latency possible. Moreover you know where
your data are.

## Database types

### SQL

* [PostgreSQL]({% post_url databases/postgresql/2000-01-01-start %})
* [MySQL]({% post_url databases/mysql/2000-01-01-start %})

### NoSQL

* [MongoDB]({% post_url databases/mongodb/2000-01-01-start %})
* [Redis]({% post_url databases/redis/2000-01-01-start %})
* [Elasticsearch]({% post_url databases/elasticsearch/2000-01-01-start %})
* [InfluxDB]({% post_url databases/influxdb/2000-01-01-start %})

## Encryption at Rest

All databases created after the 6th of January 2019 have encryption at rest
enabled. In other words, all your data are encrypted before being stored on
disk.

Encryption at rest on our database offer leverage a feature of the Linux Kernel
allowing to encrypt data at the disk level named `dm-crypt`. The algorithm used
is `aes-xts-plain64` with a key size of 256 bytes and hashed using SHA-256. This
method is considered secured and standard in the industry. To reduce the attack
surface, each instance of each database has its own cryptographic key to protect
its data, so getting access to one key wouldn't allow an attacker to get plain
data from another database. The keys are stored in a database which is itself
encrypted and protected by authentication.
