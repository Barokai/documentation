You can use the script `dbclient-fetcher` to download and install it. Using this script is
as simple as:

```bash
[10:48] Scalingo ~ $ dbclient-fetcher mongo
---> Download and extract the database CLI
---> Database CLI installed:
MongoDB shell version: 3.4.9
```

If you ever need a specific version, just add it as a second parameter:

```bash
[10:48] Scalingo ~ $ dbclient-fetcher mongo 3.2
---> Download and extract the database CLI
---> Database CLI installed:
MongoDB shell version: 3.2.17
```
