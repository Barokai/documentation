If your database is in a paid plan (i.e. it's not "free plan"), we'll make
automated backups of your database on a daily basis, at around 1 AM Central
European Time (CET or UTC+0100). You can also manually trigger a backup for your
database at any time you want. We keep the last 30 backups for your database.
