  # The application environment

  The environment should be used to configure your application. When your
  project is deployed and a new container is started, all the variables defined
  in your environment.

  You can define your environment through the environment tab of the dashboard
  page of your application.

  ## Variable alias

  You can define aliases of environment variables:

  For example:

  * `DATABASE_URL` -> `$SCALINGO_MONGO_URL`

  In this case the `DATABASE_URL` becomes an alias of `SCALINGO_MONGO_URL` value.

  ## Good practices

  Using the environment to configure your application is one of twelve good practices
  defined in [the 12 factors](http://12factor.net/).

  You should avoid writing any credentials in the files managed by `git`.

  ## Accessing the environment from your app

  The following example is to get the value of the `PORT` variable.

  #### Ruby

  ```ruby
  ENV["PORT"]
  ```

  #### Go

  ```go
  os.Getenv("PORT")
  ```

  #### Javascript

  ```js
  process.env.PORT
  ```

  #### Python

  ```python
  os.getenv("PORT")
  ```

  #### PHP

  ```php
  $_ENV["PORT"]
  ```

  #### Other languages

  The process shoul not be really different, refer to the documentation of
  the standard library of your language.
