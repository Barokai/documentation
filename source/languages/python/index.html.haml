  # Python

  The python Language is supported

  ## Versions

  Python 2 and Python 3 are both completely supported, you can specify the runtime version in th
  `runtime.txt` file at the root of your repository.

  Example of `runtime.txt` which would install python 3.4.1:

  ```
  3.4.1
  ```

  ## Frameworks

  We handle most of the common frameworks. Obviously, Django is among them. You just need ton
  configure your application to bind the port defined by the environment variable `$PORT`
