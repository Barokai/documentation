  The ruby language is supported

  ## Buildpack

  [Link to Ruby Buildpack](https://github.com/Appsdeck/heroku-buildpack-ruby)

  The buildpack is based on `bundler`, so on the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` of your project

  ## Specifying a custom ruby version

  Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  source "https://rubygems.org"

  ruby "2.1.3"

  â€¦
  ```
