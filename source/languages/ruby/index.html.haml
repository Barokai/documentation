  # Support

  Ruby is entirely supported by Appsdeck, furthermore, custom support is added
  for the Rails framework in all its versions.

  * [Getting Started with Rails](/languages/ruby/getting-started-with-rails.html)

  ## Buildpack

  The buildpack is based on `bundler` and will install the dependencies defined
  in the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` of your project. ([source of the
  buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/heroku-buildpack-ruby))

  ## Ruby application

  ### Detection

  Presence of a `Gemfile`

  ## Rack based application

  ### Detection

  Presence of a `config.ru`

  ### Environment

  When a rack application is detected, the following environment variable will be set:

  * `RACK_ENV` → `production`

  ## Rails application

  ### Detection

  #### Rails 2

  Presence of a `config/environment.rb`

  #### Rails 3, Rails 4

  Presence of a `config/application.rb`

  ### Environment

  * `RACK_ENV` → `production`
  * `RAILS_ENV` → `production`

  ## Specifying a custom ruby runtime

  If your need to install a custom version of ruby, you can achieve that by specifying
  it in your Gemfile:

  ### Ruby MRI 2.1.3

  ```ruby
  ruby "2.1.3"
  ```

  ### JRuby 1.9.3

  ```ruby
  ruby "1.9.3", :engine => "jruby", :engine_version => "1.7.8"
  ```
