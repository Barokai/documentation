%h1 Getting started with Meteor

%h2 Initialize your application

:markdown
  ```bash
  # Install meteor
  $ curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh

  # Create your app
  $ meteor create meteor-app
  $ cd meteor-app

  # Add everything in the GIT repository
  $ git init .
  $ git commit -m "Init meteor application"
  ```

%h2 Provision a MongoDB database

:markdown
  The meteor framework uses extensively MongoDB as a datastore,
  so you need an available instance for you application.

  * Go on the [dashboard](https://my.scalingo.com/apps) of your application.
  * Select the __Addons__ tab
  * Choose the addon __MongoDB__
  * Select the __Environment__ tab
  * Add the environment variable
    * `MONGO_URL` → `$SCALINGO_MONGO_URL`

%blockquote.tip
  By default, meteor looks for the environment variable MONGO_URL to define its database.

%h2 Create your application on Scalingo and deploy

%blockquote.info
  You can also use our web dashboard to achieve this operation

:markdown
  ```bash
  $ scalingo create meteor-app
  Git repository detected: remote scalingo added
  → 'git push scalingo master' to deploy your app

  $ git push scalingo master
  ```

%h2 Access your application

:markdown
  ```
   …
   Waiting for your application to boot... 
   <-- https://meteor-app.scalingo.io -->
  ```

Now you can have fun with meteor and all its real-time feature. Of course, we support websocket!
