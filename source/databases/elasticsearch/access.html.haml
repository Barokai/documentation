  # Access your Elasticsearch search engine

    You need to have our command line utility
    [Documentation](/cli) - [http://cli.scalingo.com](http://cli.scalingo.com)

  The difference between this data storage engine and the others is that Elasticsearch
  communicates over HTTP, so you can use any tool built for that, you don't have to use
  an official client. The most common command line tool is `curl`, the following example
  is using it.

  ## Use `scalingo run`

  ```
  scalingo -a <application name> run curl http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>
  ```

  ### Example

  If my application's name is 'example' and it has the environment variable
  `SCALINGO_ELASTICSEARCH_URL = "http://example-123:H_grwjqBteMMrVye442Zw6@example-123.elasticsearch.dbs.scalingo.com:30000/example-123"`

  You can run:

  ```
  $ scalingo -a example run curl $SCALINGO_ELASTICSEARCH_URL
  {
    "status" : 200,
    "name" : "the Tomorrow Man Zarrko",
    "version" : {
      "number" : "1.3.4",
      "build_hash" : "a70f3ccb52200f8f2c87e9c370c6597448eb3e45",
      "build_timestamp" : "2014-09-30T09:07:17Z",
      "build_snapshot" : false,
      "lucene_version" : "4.9"
    },
    "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
  }
  ```
