# Command Line Tool

## Installation

We provide a command line tool able to interact with the platform.

You can find it here with its documentation [http://cli.scalingo.com](http://cli.scalingo.com)

## Tips

* You can use tne environment `SCALINGO_APP` instead of using the `--app` flag
* If your current directory is the base directory of your project
  and that your git repository has a remote named 'scalingo', your
  don't need to specify `--app <name>` it will be detected automatically.
