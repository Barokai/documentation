  # First Steps

  ## Deployment requirements

  ### GIT

  Deploying an application on Scalingo requires you to have GIT installed.

  * Linux: Use your package manager to install it. (example: `apt-get install git`)
  * Mac OS: If you've installed XCode, GIT has been automatically installed. Otherwise
    install it from [GIT official website](http://git-scm.com/download/mac)
  * Windows: Install if from [GIT official website](http://git-scm.com/download/mac)

  ### SSH Key setup

  To identify that you are allowed to push to your application, you need to setup SSH
  authentication.

  * [Guide for Linux](/ssh/linux.html)
  * [Guide for MacOS](/ssh/macos.html)
  * Guide for Windows: coming soon...

  For any operating system, you need to copy the content of the public key to your account.

  With our dashbaord:

  https://my.scalingo.com/apps/keys

  With our command line client:

  ```
  scalingo keys-add [name of the key] [path to the key]

  # Example:

  scalingo keys-add Laptop ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
