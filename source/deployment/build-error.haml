%h1 Application build errors

%p 
  When your application is deployed, the dependencies are gathered and are packaged
  into an
  %em application image

%h2
  %a{id: "buildpack", ref: "#"}
  Invalid return code from buildpack

:markdown
  You application image is built using a buildpack ([List of buildpacks](/buildpacks)).
  If the buildpack exits with an error, it is probably linked to your project. You should 
  be able to see the content of the error in your console, then adapt your code according to it.

  If you think the error comes from our buildpacks, feel free to contact us and we will fix
  it as soon as we can.

%h2
  %a{id: "size", href: "#"}
  Image too large

:markdown
  The maximal size of an application image is __500MB__. If your assets, your dependencies
  and the code of your application is weighing more that this limit. Try to remove unused
  external dependencies or assets. If you absolutely need all these data, please contact
  us at [support@scalingo.com](mailto:support@scalingo.com).

%blockquote.info
  Why this quota? Besides being a simple security limit, this quota is also present to
  preserve the PaaS user experience. A large image results in longer deployments, the
  instantaneity aspect is lost.
