%h1 Application start errors

%p 
  After creating the container image of your application, it is deployed
  in our infrastructure, the following errors may happend if your application
  is not configured correctly.

%p
  If something wrong happens, the first reflex to have is to look at the logs
  of your app, in most of the case, all the information you need is displayed
  here.

%h2
  %a{id: "timeout", href: "#"}
  Boot Timeout

%p
  When started on our servers, your application has
  %strong 60 seconds
  to bind the port defined by the environment variable
  %code PORT
  \. After this delay, we consider that your application is not able to
  boot and this error happens.

%h3 Common causes
%ul
  %li
    The server is not listening on the port defined by the environment
    variable
    %code PORT
    \. Then your application is running correctly but it is not reachable.

%h2
  %a{id: "crashed", href: "#"}
  Crash of the application

%p
  When your application starts, it may stops unexpectedly for various reasons
  related to your project.

%h3 Common causes
%ul
  %li
    Syntax error and import error in your code. Make sure that your project is
    working correctly locally before deploying it on our platform. If it doesn't,
    it won't be better here.
  %li
    The database link is badly configured. If you are using our builtin
    database addons, we create a environment variable with a name following
    this scheme:
    %code SCALINGO_{DB_TYPE}_URL
    So your application has to use this value or you can rename it to fit
    your needs.
