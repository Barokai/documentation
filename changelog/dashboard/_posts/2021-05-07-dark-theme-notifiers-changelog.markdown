title:	'Dark theme, notifiers/alerts, changelog'
---

Re-introducing the good practice of publishing the latests changes in our changelog.

* Support for dark theme. User preference and fallback on system detection
* Changelog items are visible in the Overview section
* App: notifiers and alerts are now fully manageable from the dashboard
* App/Logs: the selected font-size is remembered

Also some bugfixes and wording/translations improvements.
