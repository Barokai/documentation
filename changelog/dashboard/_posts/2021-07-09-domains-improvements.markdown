The domain section was reworked: the listing now displays clearer information about the current state of the domain configuration / SSL certificate.

There is also a new per-domain page dedicated to solving the issues regarding the domain configuration, the automatic certificate generation, and uploading/removing a custom SSL certificate is again possible.
